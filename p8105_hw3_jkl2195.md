Loads the data

# Problem 1

There are a total of 1384617 rows and 15 cols in this dataset. This
dataset contains characterization of Instacart orders. Some
characterization includes product name, aisles (ex: fresh vegetables,  
lunch meat), department(ex: produce, deli), if the product has been
ordered by the same customer before, the order which customer selects
each product, the days since last order, and its product and order id.
The data contains 39123 products, 131209, orders from 131209 distinct
users.

There are in total of 134 aisles with the top three ordered fresh
vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, 150609, 150473,
78493.

This is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

``` r

# Problem 2

Clean up data by clean up variable names, focus on the “Overall Health”
topic, removing data entries with reponses as “Very good”, and convert
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”.

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names("snake") |>
  filter(topic %in% c("Overall Health")) |>
  rename(
    state = locationabbr,
    location = locationdesc
  ) |>
  filter(!response %in% c("Very good")) |>
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Excellent"))
  )
```

**Q: In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
about in 2010?**

``` r

  filter(year == 2002) |>
  group_by(state) |>

  summarize(num_of_locations = n()) |>
  filter(num_of_locations >= 7) |>
  mutate(

  filter(num_of_locations >= 7) |>
  mutate(
    location_full = state.name[match(state, state.abb)]
  )|>
  pull(location_full)
```

In 2002, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania (6 total) were observed at 7 or more locations. And
in 2010, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, North
Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Texas, Washington (14 total) were observed at 7 or more
locations

This is a “spaghetti” plot limited of the Excellent responses of each
states that maps averages the data_value across locations within a state
over the years.

``` r

# Problem 3

**Background:** Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to
self-report techniques for studying physical activity in observational
studies and clinical trials, largely because of their relative
objectivity. During observation periods, the devices can measure MIMS in
a short period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers
can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.

Participants have similar age distribution between each sex with
education less than high school and more than high school. For
participants with education high school or equivalent, the age
distribution for male tend to have a younger concentration than female,

The total activities for male participants drop by age until 50. Then
the total activities steadily increase at a constant rate according to
the estimation. This could be dued to the outliers for two between 65
and 70 and one at age 80. Female participants tends to boost their
activity until age 30 and decreases afterwards. The activities had a
small boost at age 50 - 60 and another increase after age 65. Again,
this could be affected by the existing outliers. In total, female
participants have a higher activity values between age 25 to 60, and 72
to 80. Male participants have a higher activities values before age 25
and between age 60 to 72.

At a glance, participants increases their activities from 250 min (~4:10
am) to 500 min (~8:20am). Groups with education high school equivalent
and more than high school maintain a constant activities value between
500 min(~8:20am) to 1125 min (~6:45pm). Less than high school group
reached the highest at the beginning of the time frame compared to other
groups and decrease to around the same level as the other groups. This
could be due to lower education group tends to have a job require more
physical activities than other groups. Transportation involved during
communte time may also affects this trend. Female participants have a
higher physical activity value at this time frame, with the highest
disparity in the more than high school group. A possible explanation is
that female participants tends to get busier with children,
self-development, career, etc.. Lastly, the activity decreases to range
0 to 2.5 from 1125 min (~6:45pm) to 250 min (~4:10 am), with male
participants having higher physical activities after 0 min (12pm).
